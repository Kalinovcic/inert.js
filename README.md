# inert.js

Like React ⚛, but Inert 🗿.

## Quick start

```console
$ iexplore.exe example.html
```

## Performance

According to web development logic 🧠, this library is _Blazing Fast_ ⚡, with a 0.7KB runtime 😍 (min+gzip).

The library itself was, however, never profiled 🤪. But it might be pretty good 🤞.
